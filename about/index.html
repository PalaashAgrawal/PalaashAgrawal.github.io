<h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
<p>I am a pre-final year undergrad student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. I am</p>
<p>I am currently working as an AI Research Assistant at Central Electronics Research Institute (CEERI),Pilani, India where I am working on a Computer Vision research project based on Group Activity Recognition. In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked as a Machine Learning Intern at Bhaskaracharya National Institute of Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N), Gandhinagar, India, where I led a team of three interns working on the project of <em>Agricultural Boundary Segmentation</em> , under the supervision of Dr. M.B. Potdar (Project Director and Principal Scientist at the Institute.</p>
<p>In 2020, I worked on a research project based on Optimization of the Operating Powerpoint of Solar Panels through modern Deep Learning techniques. My paper titled &ldquo;A Modified Neural Network Design Approach to track Maximum Powerpoint of Solar Photovoltaic Cells” has been accepted for publication in the journal <em>Intelligent Renewable Energy Systems: Integrating Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Optimization Algorithms</em>, Wiley, Scrivener Publishing (Scopus indexing), 2021.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-my-ongoing-ai-projects">Some of my ongoing AI projects</h2>
<p>Currently I am working on an independent research project which I call, (as of now) - &ldquo;Contour Descent Optimization for Deep Learning&rdquo;. Objective: To propose a novel optimization method to accelerate the gradient descent algorithm by manifold. The approachis to Build a Neural Network that has been pre-trained upon large scale datasets and standard problems. This Neural Network learns the state of the loss contour, rather than features of the data. This will help skip large parts of training, by simply identifying contours similar to already trained-upon contours. You can write me an email if you wish to collaborate!</p>
<p>I am also working on an improved Spotify Reccomendation System. Currently, Spotify uses 3 recommendation models in ensemble - Collaborative filtering, NLP, and Audio based models. Objective: Add a 4th, video based deep learning model to identify genres/emotions through visual analysis.
Approach: Gather uniformly spaced screenshots of official videos of songs through the YouTube API, and add them along with data from Spotify API. A 4th model (sequential Convolutional Neural Network) will be used in ensemble to the 3 other models to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>I am a Teaching Assistant for the Machine Learning Course at my University. I am responsible for designing and conducting practical sessions in Machine Learning, implementing research papers and clearing theoretical and code-related doubts/issues. My Machine Learning sessions are available publically at this website, as well as the <a href="http://ktiwari.in/ml/wp-labSessions.html">course-website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-research-interests-and-views-on-the-current-state-of-ai">My Research Interests and views on the current state of AI</h2>
<p>I wish to work on fundamental AI research methods and techniques, rather than specific problems. I think that the current state of Deep Learning is going to change very soon, from the roots - for example, Neural Networks won&rsquo;t use the linear approach in a few years, and optimization methods will shift from convex optimization techniques to more generalized optimization techniques.</p>
<p>Also, I hope to see self-supervised learning become more dominant. However the current state of self-supervised learning is very crude, atleast in comparison to supervised learning techniques. But this might be the way AI systems can acheive &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo;, and in general, a stronger method to derive information from data.</p>
<p>In the near future, AI disciplines such as Computer Vision, NLP and structured problems, will unify in terms of representation methods. This is the way AI can shift from Narrow Intelligence to a state of more General Intelligence, since a single model will be able to combine information from different types of data. Besides this, I am also excited to see how different AI systems can start collaborating. The end goal would be to build a swarm-like system, but its a fairly long shot as of now.</p>
<h2 id="my-hobbies-and-interests">My hobbies and interests</h2>
<p>I am also a guitarist and bassist. I&rsquo;ve played the guitar since I was 10 years old. Back in University, I was part of the Music Club, where we organised and performed multiple music concerts for the students there. I&rsquo;ve probably learnt more about team work, discipline and punctuality there, than anywhere else, and I&rsquo;m really thankful for that.</p>

<p>I also run a (currently online) weekly study session, where I help beginners in AI understand concepts in a lucid language. A lot of beginners simply leave AI because the math might seem intimidating. But I believe in a top-down approach of learning, which says, that you Don&rsquo;t need to know in-depth math to get started with Machine Learning. This is heavily inspired by Jeremy Howard&rsquo;s growing community - <em>Fast.ai</em>, which goes by the (unsaid) philosophy - <em>More code, less Mathematics and Theory</em>. Following the same philosophy, anyone who takes my Machine Learning practical sessions need not know Any advanced theory at all, and is guaranteed to building world class, really interesting Real World applications in as less as one hour of effort! I&rsquo;m proud of it!</p>
